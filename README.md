# Rusty (Math) Notes
> Author: Ratnodeep Bandyopadhyay ([@QuarterShotofEspresso](https://github.com/QuarterShotofEspresso))

## What's this about?
A collection of notes from various math classes over the years--all in one location where I'm hoping to a have a prim & proper reference from anywhere I could possibly wish to have them.

Notes are accessible at <todo: paste link>

## Dependencies
Naturally, this project was written in 100% Rust <333. Listed are some of the crates used for this project:
- [Leptos](https://leptos.dev)
- [latex2mathml](https://crates.io/crates/latex2mathml) ([supported synatx](https://github.com/osanshouo/latex2mathml/blob/master/src/token.rs))

## Todo
- Math font sucks. 
- Pages need to be added for scaling notes.
- Development proc could be further improved.
- Content can continue to be added at the very least. And eventually a hosted on github (hopefully).
