# Rusty (Math) Notes
> Author: Ratnodeep Bandyopadhyay ([@QuarterShotofEspresso](https://github.com/QuarterShotofEspresso))

## What's this about?
A starter project for gaining expereince with Rust + Leptos. A collection of notes from various math classes over the years--all in one location where I'm hoping to a have a prim & proper reference from anywhere I could possibly wish to have them. Displayed like a long latex document, but all written in Rust.

Notes are accessible at <todo: paste link>

## Dependencies
Naturally, this project was written in 100% Rust <333. Listed are some of the crates used for this project:
- [Leptos](https://leptos.dev)
- [latex2mathml](https://crates.io/crates/latex2mathml) ([supported syntax](https://github.com/osanshouo/latex2mathml/blob/master/src/token.rs))
- [Latin Modern Math](https://www.cdnfonts.com/latin-modern-math.font) (font)

## Todo
- ~~Font sucks.~~ Fixed: Latin Modern Math.
- ~~Development proc could be further improved.~~ Fixed. Boilerplate's been boiled away.
- More content needs to be added.
- Host on github pages (after content for 171 is up to date).
- Pages need to be added for scaling notes + classes.
- Project structure needs to be cleaned up a little.
- For the home page add a square animation that spans the width of the `journal` and add topic selections below that.
